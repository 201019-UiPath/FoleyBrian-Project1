# Brew Crew

## Project Description
Brew Crew is a beer management system for brewery owners. It enables brewery managers to add, edit, and delete beers specific to their brewery. Additionally, customers can access an IOS app and view beers at a specified location, place orders, create an account, and view order history.

## Technlologies Used

* ASP.net
* Entity Framework Core
* PostgreSQL
* xUnit Testing
* C#
* Swift 5.2
* HTML
* CSS

## Features

Feature Roll-Out:
* Beer sensor client that obtains the amount of beer left in a keg. This will communicate with the postgreSQL DB through the API
* In-depth data analysis for brewery managers. This will give the managers the option to generate charts and other visual tools to be able to view beer sells by type, data(season), alcohol content, bitterness, and name

## Getting Started
Note: to run the IOS application, you must have macOS 10.14 or later and xcode 11 installed. Most of the code is not swift 5.2 specific so if you decide to use an earlier version of swift only minor changes, if any at all, would need to be changed. Therefore, it is possible to run on earlier versions of macOS.

clone the directory:
`git clone `
